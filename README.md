# 16-BKDevPortfolio
An updated developer portfolio page with enhanced design and content

I spent some extra time developing graphics, choosing colors, and conceiving a layout that is more personal and reflective of my professional style.  While I'm still learning new skills and growing, I think this attempt does justice to my improved abilities.
